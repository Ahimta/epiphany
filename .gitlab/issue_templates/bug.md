Hey, thanks for reporting your problem with Epiphany.

# Software versions

Please include the following in your report:

Epiphany version:
WebKitGTK+ version:
Operating system and version:

Check the About dialog if you're not sure what software versions you have.

# Web content bugs

This is the wrong place to report bugs with web content (e.g. incorrect rendering, broken JavaScript, problems with video playback). These problems should be reported directly on https://bugs.webkit.org. To ensure we see your bug, be sure to select the 'WebKit Gtk' component when reporting, and prefix the bug title with [GTK].

In general, only problems with the GTK+ user interface around the web view (e.g. menus, preferences dialog, window chrome) or Epiphany features (e.g. Firefox Sync, adblocker, web apps) should be reported here.

# Crashes

If Epiphany crashed, then we really need a backtrace taken in gdb with 'bt full' in order to solve the problem. Be sure to install the necessary debuginfo packages for all frames that appear in the crashing thread. [Learn how to include a good backtrace.](https://wiki.gnome.org/Community/GettingInTouch/Bugzilla/GettingTraces)

If you see the message "Oops! Something went wrong while displaying this page," that means WebKit has crashed. Please follow the steps above to take a quality backtrace and to report it on WebKit Bugzilla.
