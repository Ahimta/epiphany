The plan is to fix the things which suck in gtkmozembed and some of
which require direct access to the embedding layer to be fixed.

Note that the following plans are not set in stone.

- lifecycle:
  Move from the push_startup/pop_startup lifecycle management to explicit
  init/shutdown.
- dom events:
  Make the DOM events signals actually useful by implementing a DOM context
  class accessible from C, where the context is only calculated on demand
  (since DOM signals can be emitted frequently and getting context is slow)
- gtk-like tooltips:
  Make tooltips follow mouse (like in evince), not time out, and and make sure
  they don't fall off the side of the screen
- printing:
  Integrate with gtk+ 2.10 printing out-of-the-box; atm every application
  codes its own libgnomeprint ps-to-printer support.
- more gobject-like:
  Make use of gobject properties instead of signals (Ã  la EphyTab)
- find:
  Copy EphyEmbedFind.
- prefs:
  Provide access to mozilla prefs from C (like mozilla-notifiers.h in epiphany/embed/mozilla/)
  and map common gconf prefs to moz prefs automatically (like mozilla-notifiers.cpp).
  That way we can also share the font prefs between epiphany, yelp and devhelp.
