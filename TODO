- Check that filtering is not done more than one time on bookmarks dialogs init
- change font size pref name or convert if possible

Downloader:

- Fixup column sizing. Ideally filename should get all available space, the
others column can get the minimum (for progress we can just fixup requisition
in the renderer to something sane)
- Fix hash table destruction. Free row refs and unref download objects.
- Fix crash on download finish, both on context menu and click downloads
- Cleanup downloader-view, there is prolly still crap here and there
- Add LOGs on all objects involved in download. Init/Finalize and in c++
constructor/destructor. Verify that references are correct == objects
are destroyed at right time.
- Probably use cur from total instead of just total in the size field
- Deal with the case where total size is unknown (we need special rendering
for progress too I guess)
- Initialize progress values when starting the download
- Fix at least the Stop button. Probably we should also remove the download
from list in that case.
- Need a way to do downloads without view, for favicons
- Maybe drop details crap if we get the ok from usability bigs
