- Check that filtering is not done more than one time on bookmarks dialogs init
- change font size pref name or convert if possible

Downloader:

- Fixup column sizing. Ideally filename should get all available space, the
others column can get the minimum (for progress we can just fixup requisition
in the renderer to something sane)
- Fix crash on download finish, both on context menu and click downloads
- Probably use cur from total instead of just total in the size field
- Deal with the case where total size is unknown (we need special rendering
for progress too I guess)
- Initialize progress values when starting the download
- Fix at least the Stop button. Probably we should also remove the download
from list in that case.
- Maybe drop details crap if we get the ok from usability bigs
